# Personal Dashboard

Created in Python's Flask with PostgreSQL database system.

It's going to be app for daily tasks. User will be able to post notes, add friends from the outside the app 
and asign to them all his/her payables and receivables. 

I'm going to implement Google Search API to make this project great home page. 

Currently I'm struggling with front-end side of project.
