# Personal Dashboard

Created in Python's Flask with PostgreSQL database system.

It's going to be app for daily task. User will be able to post notes, add friends from the outside the app 
and asign to them all his/her payables and receivables. Also will be able to upload some photos for a background slider which
I'm going to implement.

Maybe I will try to implement Google Calendar API in the future as well.
